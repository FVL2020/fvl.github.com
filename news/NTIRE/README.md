# FVL members participated in the 9th edition of CVPR2024 workshop NTIRE: New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement challenge and won first place among 427 participants.

Recently, the New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement Workshop and Associated Challenges (NTIRE) organized by CVPR 2024, the top international conference on computer vision, have been awarded one after another.

Under the guidance of Associate Professor Zhi Jin from the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Shen Zhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University, the team consisting of graduate student Hongjun Wu from class of 2023, graduate student Chenxi Wang from class of 2021, and undergraduate student Haitao Ling from class of 2020 was awarded the winner award of the Low-Light Enhancement Challenge Track.

The NTlRE Challenge organized by CVPR is one of the most influential international events in the field of intelligent image restoration and enhancement, and has been held for 9 consecutive sessions since 2016. NTIRE 2024 is divided into a total of 23 tracks for low-light enhancement, stereo image super-resolution, portrait quality assessment, etc., which not only attracts domestic and foreign universities such as Johns Hopkins University, the University of Toronto, Tsinghua University and Peking University, but also attracts the participation of Huawei, Tencent, Samsung and other technology companies.

Low-light enhancement is the process of making images brighter,sharper and more visually appealing without introducing excessive noise or distortion. The challenge includes scenarios such as high resolution (2K or 4K), non-uniform illumination, backlighting, extreme darkness, and night scenes. 

Our group has deeply cultivated low-level vision and proposed models such as FourLLlE, BCNet and lEDCN for the thorny problems in the field of low-light enhancement. The methods designed in this competition not only have direct application value, but also have important inspirations and impetus fortasks such as image super-resolution and denoise.
