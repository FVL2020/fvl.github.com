Four students from our research group participated in the event. Through the learning of tutorials and workshops, they have a clearer understanding of industry dynamics and academic frontiers. The diverse presentations provided them with the opportunity to grasp the current state of research in various fields and also inspired their own research work. In addition, they also had a paper poster display, which attracted many scholars to come and communicate.
