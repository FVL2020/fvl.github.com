# The Sino-German Mobility Project Joint Exchange Meeting was successfully held.

In March 2023, Dr. Xu Xiao and his delegation from the Media Technology Laboratory of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany were invited by Associate Professor Zhi Jin of our school to come to the Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University to gather with members of the Frontier Vision Laboratory led by Associate Professor Zhi Jin to conduct in-depth academic discussions. comminicate.

At the beginning of the exchange meeting, Associate Professor Zhi Jin, the Chinese project leader, first expressed a warm welcome to the arrival of Dr. Xu Xiao and his delegation. She hoped that this exchange meeting would be an opportunity for both parties to have more exchange and cooperation opportunities in the future. Subsequently, the academic exchange and sharing session of this joint exchange meeting officially began. Dr. Xu Xiao, doctoral student Wu Yuankai, doctoral student Constantin Patsch, doctoral student Driton Salihu, and doctoral student Michael G. Adam shared their work respectively. In addition to sharing scientific research work in their own fields, everyone also shared literature and discussed the diffusion model, a hot topic in the field of machine learning.

Constantin Patsch, PhD candidate (TUM), mainly studies AIâ€™s understanding of human activities and work related to human-computer interaction. In this exchange meeting, he first introduced the relevant content of video motion segmentation and shared some of his work in this direction. He then shared a work using a diffusion model to model long videos.

Driton Salihu PhD student (TUM) focuses on the reconstruction of 3D indoor environments. He introduced instance-based 3D digital twins at this exchange meeting and shared his two main works in this direction. At the same time, based on his own research direction, he shared with everyone the latest work on 3D reconstruction based on diffusion models. Although their research directions are not the same as their own, everyone has said that they have benefited a lot.
