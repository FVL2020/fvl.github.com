The purpose of the visit to Germany is to further advance the implementation of Sino-Germany international cooperation programme, which focuses on promoting academic exchanges between researchers and young scholars from both countries.

During the exchange, both sides reported and summarized their latest research, which promoted mutual understanding. And then our doctors were involved in research on vision-related robot algorithms, and visited the Artificial Intelligence Factory in Bavaria, where the humanoid robotic assistant for the elderly is being researched (GARMI).
