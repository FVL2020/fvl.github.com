# October 20, 2023 Scholar Chao Dong, the first author of SRCNN, visited our lab and gave a talk.

Scholar Chao Dong is a well-acclaimed researcher at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and a leading scientist at the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He has been named one of the top 2% of scientists in the world by Stanford University in 2021 and the AI 2000 Most Influential Scholar in the World in Artificial Intelligence by Tsinghua University in 2022. Scholar Chao Dong has made significant contributions to the fields of image super-resolution, denoising, and enhancement and is renowned for his expertise in low-level computer vision.


During his visit, Scholar Chao Dong shared the details of three major projects undertaken by his research group aiming to integrate low-level visual tasks into a unified framework and create efficient models to address the generalization problem. The presentation was an exhaustive exploration of the state-of-the-art DiffBIR general image restoration algorithm that utilizes a pre-trained restoration module to eliminate general degradation before reconstructing the image through Stable Diffusion via LAControNet. He also introduced PromptGIP, which unifies 15 low-level visual tasks and facilitates efficient switching between corresponding tasks through input examples. In addition, Scholar Chao Dong presented a rigorous analysis of classic deep deraining models, highlighting their tendency to learn less complex space and emphasizing the importance of reducing the number of training images to guide the network to learn image distribution instead of degradation. The implications of this finding are significant, as it indicates that big data is not the only solution to address the generalization problem.


The event concluded with Associate Professor Zhi Jin presenting some commemorative books to Scholar Chao Dong as tokens of appreciation for his visit and invaluable insights.
