From May 9 to 11, 2025, the Chinese Congress on Image and Graphics (CCIG 2025) was successfully held in Changsha. The conference featured 6 keynote speeches, 36 academic forums, 8 specialized forums, 1 industry forum, and over 170 project and poster presentations. These covered a wide range of fields, including generative artificial intelligence, large models, digital humans, machine learning, brain-inspired computing, spatial information perception, medical images, and remote sensing images.
Attended by more than 4,000 participants from both academia and industry, the three-day event fostered professional exchange and in-depth discussions, aiming to explore new technologies and ideas in image and graphics and to jointly plan the future development.

Four students from our research group participated in the event. Through the learning of tutorials and workshops, they have a clearer understanding of industry dynamics and academic frontiers. The diverse presentations provided them with the opportunity to grasp the current state of research in various fields and also inspired their own research work. In addition, they also had a paper poster display, which attracted many scholars to come and communicate.
