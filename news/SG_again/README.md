# September 2023, the Sino-German Mobility Project Joint Exchange Meeting was successfully held again.

In September 2023, at the invitation of Associate Professor Zhi Jin of our school, the Media Technology Laboratory of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany came to the Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University for visit and exchange again after half a year. The three visiting doctoral students had in-depth academic exchanges with the Frontier Vision Laboratory led by Associate Professor Zhi Jin. The visitors this time are doctoral students Yang Dong, doctoral students Xiong Mengchen and doctoral students Wang Zican. Associate Professor Zhi Jin, the Chinese project leader, first extended a warm welcome to their arrival. Then the exchange meeting officially started.

Xiong Mengchen, a doctoral student, mainly focuses on the field of sensor fusion, focusing on exploring radar-based environmental perception issues under adverse conditions. At the exchange meeting, she showed everyone how smart cars can perform efficient environmental perception based on radar under adverse conditions, and shared her physical results.

The research of doctoral student Wang Zican mainly focuses on the control method of time-delay network teleoperation and the optimization and evaluation of experience quality. Data processing, machine learning, robotics and virtual reality are also studied as auxiliary tools to his main research goals. In this exchange meeting, he shared the analysis, implementation and evaluation of remote operation control systems, and also shared some of his thoughts and experiences from coming to Germany to study for a doctoral degree from a domestic university.
