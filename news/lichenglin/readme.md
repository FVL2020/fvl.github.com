In his lecture, Prof. Li first introduced the latest developments in reinforcement learning decision optimization theory in stochastic non-stationary environments. He then proposed three potential solutions to current research challenges: domain randomization, variance reduction in policy gradient estimation, and meta-reinforcement learning. He subsequently presented the work of his group, which applied these theoretical frameworks to the task of video adaptive transmission rate control, resulting in improved transmission performance and enhanced generalization across various network conditions. Finally, Prof. Li explored the future application prospects of reinforcement learning decision optimization methods in smart healthcare, including health management and disease treatment, and discussed potential breakthroughs in related technologies.
